# The Amazon Case Study
This guided case study provided by Corporate Finance Institute (CFI) provided a comprehensive hands-on experience. This case study involved going to several industry research reports from **IBISWorld**, Amazon's 10-K filings, macroeconoimc reports such as **PwC Global Economy Outlook** to build a robust valuation model for Amazon Inc. 
<br><br>
The model is built upon the following business valuation methods:
1. Discounted Cash FLow (DCF)
1. Sum of the Parts (SOTP)
1. Precedent Transactions

In this model, we used historical financial performance from Amazon's 10-K filings, assumptions & drivers to build a 10 years of financial forcast and calculate various metrics for DCF model.
